
1. Taking the input as number of test cases(T)

2. Taking the string as input (s)

3. checking the length of the string 

	a) if the size of string is greater than 2 then it will go inside the Loop
	
	1. using hashmap to count the frequency of the elements
	
	2. create a vector to store the frequency of the elements 

	3. sort the vector in assending order to find the fibonnaic series
		f[i]= f[i-1] + f[i-2]
	
	4. if all the frequency of the elements in the string follow the fibonnaic series order 
		then print Dynamic 
	
	5 print Not

   b) if the size of the string is less the or equal to 2 it will print not

4. end
